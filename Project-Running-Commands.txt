Project Running Commands
========================
1. conda env creation : conda create --prefix ./venv python=3.11 -y
2. conda env activate : conda activate venv/
3. Install libraries : pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Creating Project Folder / File Structure : python template.py
5. To see Tensorboard : tensorboard --logdir artifacts/prepare_callbacks/tensorboard_log_dir/
6. Run the full program : python main.py

On GitBash ðŸ”½
>> dvc init
- Execute the Pipeline >> dvc repro

DVC will track your pipeline - if everything was run already, then DVC will skip all the components (this is not the case in executing main.py - when you execute >> python main.py -> it will again run the whole pipeline)

- Want to see how the pipeline looks (visualization) (when running) >> dvc dag

Launching the FLask Application >> python app.py --> IP Address (localhost:8080)

Training the model : localhost:8080/train (delete the "artificats" folder first, then do that)
